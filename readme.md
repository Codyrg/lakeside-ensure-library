# Lakeside Ensure Library

## Overview

The Ensure Library is a Python utility library designed to streamline data validation in your applications. By providing a suite of "ensure" functions, this library helps you validate your data and inputs in a clear, declarative style.

From verifying type correctness to checking file and directory existence, this library offers a wide range of functions to make your code safer and more reliable.

## Usage

Using the ensure functions is straightforward. Simply call the desired function with the value you want to validate.

```python
ensure_positive(my_integer)
```

If the check passes, the function will return `None`. If the check fails, an appropriate exception will be raised.

## Installation

To install the Ensure Library, use pip:

```bash
pip install lakeside-ensure
```
